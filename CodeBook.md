## Feature Explaination
===========================================
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* The first variable is type of activity
* The second variable is the ID for each participant (from 1 to 30)
* The rest of the variables is the average of each measurement by activity and subject
